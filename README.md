# PROPATRADEX

## Project Description  
**PROPATRADEX** is a blockchain-integrated real estate platform designed to revolutionize property transactions. Built using the iExec platform, it offers a secure, transparent, and efficient environment for users to buy or rent properties. By leveraging Web3 technology, PROPATRADEX enhances privacy, decentralization, and user functionality in real estate transactions.
